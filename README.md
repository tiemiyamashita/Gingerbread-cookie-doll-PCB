# Gingerbread-cookie-doll-PCB
When I created this PCB, I  wanted to represent the christmas ghost through a decoration that, besides being very beautiful, is also quite delicious. That's why this electronic circuit was inspired by a gingerbread cookie doll.   Hope you all like it and everybody have a merry christmas and a 2021 full of love, peace and hope.
